# edgar_scraper

ABOUT THE PROJECT

The project is an attempt to scrape financial data from the edgar database and and price data from tingo to create an in-house database for financial analysis and build factor-driven quant models. Instead of paying a subscription to create, run and backtest your models, you can have your own proprietary database to do all of the following tasks. Simply put, the project includes no. of scrapers (edgar, wiki and tingo), a mysql database  module and a data cleaning and calculation module to help you create your own financial database.   

RELATED PROJECTS 

I am also currently working on providing a completed database file and no. of specific factor models (value, growth, momentum, quality and volatility) and a multi-factor model that uses my proprietary database built using the files here. The link will soon be uploaded.
